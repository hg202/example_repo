I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3 
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5), 
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
